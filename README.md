[Odin](http://github.com/Vanaheimr/Odin) is a little helper project to support your first steps
with the Vanaheimr graph processing stack. It comes with all neccessary Vanaheimr subprojects as
git submodules to make your life easier. In order to download the submodules type:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
	
If you want to update all submodules to their latest version type:	
	
    git submodule foreach git pull -q origin master


Thanks to btk and cosh for their unintentional help ;)
